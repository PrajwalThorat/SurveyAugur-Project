Any idea created by you, would only be considered successful, if it is able to draw engagement. 

How would you measure:
- Engagement
- Engagements are positive or negative?
- Engagements are genuine or fake?

How would you report:
- positive against negative engagement
- engagements based on different periodicity(eg,: weekends, daily prime hours, festivities and so on.)
- engagements based on lead conversion to purchase(LCP)
